# Programming in Bioinformatics

This repository contains the projects and practical assignments completed as part of the "Programming" course in the Master's in Bioinformatics at the University of Murcia. The course provides a thorough foundation in programming with a focus on Python, covering introductory concepts through to advanced data processing techniques.

## Course Overview

The "Programming" course covers a range of topics essential for bioinformatics, including:

- **Introduction to Programming**: Basics of programming structure, variable types, libraries, and string processing.
- **Data Structures**: Usage of lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries in Python.
- **Control Structures**: How to implement iterators, conditionals, loops, and recursion in Python.
- **Modules and Functions**: Creating reusable code blocks and modules to streamline coding tasks.
- **Input/Output**: Techniques for reading and writing files, managing errors, and handling exceptions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Understanding classes, objects, attributes, methods, and inheritance.
- **Data Processing**: Advanced string operations, regular expressions, using NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, database connections, and REST API interactions.

## Project Description

### Practica 1: Exploring RNA-SEQ Results
- **File**: `practica1.html`
- **Description**: This project focuses on handling input/output operations, using data structures, and implementing control structures. Load RNA-SEQ data and provide options for viewing information about each sequencing run, including the number of samples and genes per run. Allow the user to explore detailed information about specific runs, including the highest and lowest expressed genes. Implement functionality to calculate differences between samples, displaying genes with significant fold changes.

## Repository Structure
